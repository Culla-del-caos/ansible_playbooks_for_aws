Some generic playbooks that leverage the official Ansible modules for AWS. 

The goal is to create individual roles that perform specific actions on AWS that can be easily reused
At the moment the playbooks create EC2, VPN or Subnet resources in an account.

I have divided them by Roles but whole playbooks are also present.

I have also added a playbook that creates LVM disks based on some conditions.

Over time I will add more.

If you would like to contribute feel free to add new tasks and enhancements using Ansible modules, I will be sure to check and add them 

Thank you
